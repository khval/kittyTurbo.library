# kittyTurbo.library
kittyTurbo.library extension for AmosKittens

This is a complete reimplantation of “AmosPro turboPlus extension”, original was written in assembler, this is a reimplemented using the documentations as guide, and by trial and error, the aim is to allow Amos basic programs written for turbo plus extension to work in Amos Kittens. The original extension is not compatible with Amos Kittens. And kittyTurbo.library can not be used with Amos Pro.

My copyright / software license only extends to work on KittyTubro.library, I’m not the original author of the “AmosPro TruboPlus extension”, and I clime no copyright to the original source code, or binary files, nor do I clime any right to original sound & music & graphics. There these files are not included with this package. And should not be distributed with this package.
